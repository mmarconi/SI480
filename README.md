# Build Process
In the process of creating my website I utilized past assignments from CS480 to make the process easier on myself.
I used former assignments such as our Information Architecture as an outline for my website. This played a major
part in simplifying the process. I did not have to put as much time into website design since I already had a basic
layout which I wanted to follow. Aside from that I utilized the Hugo Ananke theme. I took this theme and made many edits
to it in order to manipulate it in a way I wanted to display my information. I deployed my site a countless amount of
times until it looked the way I wanted. As far as challenges go, the main thing that stood in my way in completing
this assignment was familiarizing myself with Netlify and Hugo. These are two things which I had previously never
worked with. Although this assignment presented me with an excellent learning opportunity to learn how to use these.
Through a lot of trial and error I was able to become comfortable with both of these things and create what I think
is an informative and visually appealing website.

# Audiences
The audience I had in mind when developing this site was potential employers. I designed the site to hold a lot
of the same information as my resume, as well as including an option to download my actual resume. Although I beleive
my website displays all of my information in a much easier to read fashion in comparison to a resume. I also have
added information on my website which is not included on my resume. My website also includes links to my different
social media platforms as well as my Github account. I also tried to keep a very professional feel to my website, as
the main audience I had in mind was potential employers. I think I did a good job at this, while I do have a picture of
myself on the site, I limited it to one. I thought this kept it more professional. Then I kept a consistent picture for 
the rest of my pages to keep that professional feel.

# Design Decisions
My design decisions were based off of professional documents I have completed this semester. As mentioned before, 
my website holds much of the same information as my resume and LinkedIn. As well as actually having my resume, and
a link to my LinkedIn page. I tried to keep the design simple and easy to read by putting my different sections
on different pages. I also utilized many bulleted lists to keep that simple and easy to read design.
